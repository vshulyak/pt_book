Notes on gender and number
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "o" ending is used by males when giving thanks, e.g. obrigado. Females use the "a" ending, e.g. obrigada. If you are saying thanks in the name of a group of males, a mixed sex group or a collective entity - like a corporation to a client: you use the "os" ending, e.g. obrigados. When you say thanks in the name a group of females, you use the "as" ending, e.g. obrigadas.
